# R programming : Arithmatic Operations

2+2 # Simple basic addition 
4 + 5 # use spaces b/w two operands that also works
3*4 # Multiplication
2/2 # Simple Division
12/3
2 ^3 # Power operation
2 ^ 3 + 3 ^ 2
(2 ^ 3) - (4 ^ 2)  # Using Parenthesis
4-2+3
3 ^ -2
-3 + -2
log(100) # natural log
log(100, base = 10) # log of base 10
log(100, b = 10)

# Useful functions
pi
floor(1.9)
ceiling(1.9)
round(1.9)
round(1.4)

# Modulo or Remainder operation
23 %% 5

23 %/% 5 # It will give quetionent value

# Absolute value
abs(1.9)
abs(-1.9)


args(log) # args function can use the usage of any R command
?log # "?" Give you help document for any command in html format
help(log)
example(log) # It will give example usage

# Removing the variables from console environment using rm() command
rm(list = ls())

# Ctrl + R runs the selected commands
